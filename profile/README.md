**Overview:** A core mission of the [Institute for Comparative Genomics (ICG)](https://icgenomics.ca/) is to train future generations of biodiversity scientists within a collaborative and inclusive program that places a high value on science communication, community outreach and positive social change.  To support this the ICG Microscope Observatory Program (ICG-MOP) will generate microbial data in support of both basic research and community science outreach.  

**The MOSOM platform:** The Microbial Observatory Science Outreach Modules (MOSOMs) are open-source educational modules that unify the scientific, educational and outreach objectives of the ICG.  

**Goals:**
* Improve public science literacy.
* Actively support historically underrepresented students in science.
*	Provide an open platform for using on-going ICG-MOP data collection for science education.
*	Conduct on-going assessment of Nova Scotian microbial diversity in time and space.
*	Track the prevalence of selected microbial taxa with significance to society (e.g., toxin producing cyanobacteria, antibiotic resistant bacteria, etc.).
*	Train students, educators, and general public to participate in citizen science.
